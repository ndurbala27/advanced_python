In Python, modules are files containing Python definitions and statements.

Imports allow code in one module to be reused in another.

The if __name__ == '__main__': construct is a conditional statement that determines whether
a Python script is being run as the main program or imported as a module.

When a Python file is executed directly,
the special variable __name__ is set to "__main__".

If the file is imported as a module into another script,
__name__ is set to the module's name.

The if __name__ == '__main__': block allows specific code to run only when the script is executed directly,
not when imported.
